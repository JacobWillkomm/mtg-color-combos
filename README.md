# Introduction

Magic the Gathering Color combos is a simple website to help Magic players determine the name of the color combination of the selected colors.
In Magic the Gathering, 5 types of mana are represented by 5 colors. But when played together in a deck, each unique color combination has a name from the in-universe lore.
This simple website gives the user the name based on the selected colors.

# Future optimization

This simple website could be expanded to include more specific information about color combos, with both in-universe lore and the real world context.
